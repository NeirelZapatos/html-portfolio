<h1>The Best Anime's According to Neirel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Code Geass</h3>
<p>This is the best anime I has every watched. Crazy story with plot developments that hurt my heart.</p>
<h3>Darling in the Franx</h3>
<p>Second best anime I have watched which showed what it means to be human. That's there is beauty in imperfection.</p>
<h3>Cyberpunk 2077</h3>
<p>Third best anime I have watched. It shows the brutal reality of night city and a tragic love story</p>
